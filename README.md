## Project Structure

The project follows MVVM architecture pattern with the following structure:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ home_screen/          
    â”œâ”€â”€ model/            # Contains ServiceModel and other data models
    â”œâ”€â”€ view/             # UI components (home_screen.dart, detail_screen.dart) 
    â””â”€â”€ view_model/       # HomeViewModel for business logic
```

All image assets are stored in `assets/home/` including:
